# Maple-Woksheets
This is a Maple worksheet that was created to solve numerically different orbit solutions around a star. Plots were made and organized. I used this code to learn many different techniques in Maple and eventually was able to 3D print the result with the help of a friend of mine in the physics department. I did not completely create this worksheet but got a lot of the information online. I am attempting to craeate the same solutions in Python

There is a pdf of most Maple sheets to show output
